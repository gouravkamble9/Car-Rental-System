# Car-Rental-System

This C++ code represents a Car Rental System. It provides functionality for both administrators and users to manage car rental operations. Here's a brief description of the code:

  The code defines several functions for different operations like login, registration, forgot password, admin login, adding a car, deleting a car, displaying car    details, and user login.
  
  It also defines a class called cardetails that represents the details of a car.
  
  The main function acts as the entry point of the program and presents a menu for the user to choose from various options.
  
  Based on the user's choice, the program calls corresponding functions to perform the desired operations.
  
  The program reads and writes data to text files (database.txt, car_details.txt, and book_details.txt) to store user information, car details, and booking history.
  
  The admin and user_login functions provide separate menus for administrators and users, respectively, allowing them to perform specific tasks related to car management.
  
  The cars function displays the available cars and their details.
  
  The book_car function allows users to select and book a car by entering the car code.
  
  The invoice function generates an invoice for the booked car, including customer details, car details, rental amount, etc.
  
  The code handles input validation and includes error messages in case of invalid inputs or login failures.
